# Firebase Integration Notes

## Current Status

Currently, the Firebase integration is **mocked** to focus on UI development. The authentication system is using a mock implementation that simulates Firebase Auth behavior without requiring an actual Firebase project setup.

## Mock Implementation

The mock implementation is located in:
- `src/config/firebase.ts` - Contains a mock Firebase object that simulates authentication methods
- `src/services/authService.ts` - Uses the mock Firebase object but maintains the same interface for future real integration

## Features Available in Mock Mode

- User registration (sign up)
- User authentication (sign in)
- Google sign-in (simulated)
- Password reset (simulated)
- User profile creation

## How to Use

The mock implementation allows you to test the UI flow without setting up a real Firebase project. When signing in or signing up:

- Any email and password combination will work (password must be at least 6 characters)
- Google sign-in will automatically succeed
- Password reset will simulate sending an email

## Switching to Real Firebase

When you're ready to integrate with a real Firebase project:

1. Uncomment the Firebase imports and initialization in `src/config/firebase.ts`
2. Replace the placeholder values in `firebaseConfig` with your actual Firebase project credentials
3. Remove or comment out the mock Firebase object

The rest of the application is designed to work with the real Firebase implementation without requiring changes to the UI components or authentication flow.
